# Melanoma-Detection-

In this assignment, you will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in tensorflow. 

## Problem statement: 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The data set contains the following diseases:
```
-Actinic keratosis
-Basal cell carcinoma
-Dermatofibroma
-Melanoma
-Nevus
-Pigmented benign keratosis
-Seborrheic keratosis
-Squamous cell carcinoma
-Vascular lesion
```
Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
